⚡ Digifea Lead Intelligence Hub
Real-time Clinical Intelligence & Lead Verification Engine
Digifea is a high-performance lead verification tool engineered specifically for high-stakes medical sales and clinical outreach. By leveraging the advanced reasoning of the Gemini 2.5 Flash model integrated with live Google Search grounding, the platform verifies NPI data, deconstructs complex clinic hierarchies, and generates hyper-tailored sales hooks in real-time. It transforms raw data into actionable tactical intelligence, allowing sales teams to enter conversations with unprecedented authority.
🚀 Core Features
🔍 Smart Intelligence Search
Verify any clinic, hospital, or private practice by name or phone number. The system executes a sophisticated multi-point "grounding" search to triangulate official registries with public-facing digital footprints to pull:
Decision Makers: Identifies the "Right Person" for your pitch, typically the Medical Director, Owner, or Lead Practitioner, ensuring you bypass gatekeepers and reach the ultimate authority.
Financial Estimates: Provides strategic estimations of a facility's average Accounts Receivable (AR) days and financial health based on its parent company affiliation, regional benchmarks, and operational scale.
Tech Stack Mapping: Predicts the primary EHR/PMS software (such as Epic, AthenaHealth, or Dentrix) currently in use, allowing your team to tailor technical compatibility discussions before the first call.
📂 Local Repository & History
Eliminate the risk of lost data or repetitive manual searches. Every verified result and generated strategy is instantly committed to a robust local browser repository for immediate recall.
Side-Tab History: A seamless, toggleable interface panel allows you to cycle through your research history without losing your current workspace context.
Live Filtering: Includes a high-speed search box within the history tab to instantly isolate specific leads by name, phone number, or geographic location.
Data Persistence: Utilizes persistent localStorage protocols to ensure your entire intelligence database remains intact across browser restarts or unexpected system reboots.
📤 Data Portability & Workflow Integration
Standardized Export: Effortlessly save your entire research database as a formatted .json file, facilitating easy backup or integration into external CRM systems like Salesforce or HubSpot.
Intelligent Import: Upload previously exported datasets to restore historical research, synchronize data across different team workstations, or resume long-term outreach campaigns.
🛠 Configuration Suite
API Management: Features an integrated settings dashboard where users can securely input, modify, and validate their Gemini API credentials.
Privacy & Masking: Includes a "Masked View" privacy toggle, allowing you to manage sensitive API keys in open environments without risking visual exposure.
